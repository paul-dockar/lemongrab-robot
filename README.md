##Assignment 3 - Demonstration and Competition##

## Aim ##
This assessment requires the students to apply all the techniques and skills they have learned throughout the subject to find a 'source' in a maze area. The specifications have been designed to allow multiple solutions and the students are encouraged to develop new and innovative methods. The students will need to develop a suitable solution and demonstrate it in a real scenario

## Requirements ##
You will be required to develop a robotic platform to:

* Complete a basic or advanced maze configuration.
* Operate autonomously during the mission. There should be no user intervention or control other than pressing the start button.
* Search for and locate ‘victims’ within the maze. The victims will be implemented by the home-base beacons, but their location is otherwise unknown.
* After locating a victim, play a song to indicate that the victim has been found. The robot should resume exploring the maze to find the second victim.
* Once the second victim has been located, a different song should be played to indicate that the second victim has been found. The first victim must not be mistaken for the second victim should you pass the first victim’s location more than once.
* After finding the second victim, the robot should return to the starting location by taking the shortest path.
* Avoid walls and respond appropriately to virtual walls while carrying out the tasks required for each mission.

## Demonstration ##
There will be two maze configurations available for the demonstration; basic and advanced. You will be allowed two runs and the run which scores the most marks will be recorded. You may also attempt different mazes with each one; for example you may attempt the basic maze to ensure you get some marks and then try the advanced, or have two attempts on the same maze. All maze walls higher than 100mm should be avoided. The sides of the raised platform may be detected using the bump sensors if required. The size of the maze grids are approximately 1m x1m and the walls are 400mm tall.
